# Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?

'''

It seems there might be a typographical error in your question,
If you intended to ask why one would use the zip method in Python,
I'll provide some additional reasons and use cases:
'''


list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
combined = list(zip(list1, list2))
print(combined)
